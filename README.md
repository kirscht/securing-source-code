# securing-source-code

The purpose of this page is to expose the security risks to both private and third-party repositories.

  -  Third-party libraries are essential in modern applicaiton development. Developers are able to leverage code and libraries developed and shared by third parties. This introduces security risks and external dependencies.

## Threats & Risks ##

Risks include:

Both private and third-party libraries suffer some of the same risks.

  -  **Outdated and Vulnerable Code**: Repositories may contain known security vulnerabilities susceptible to exploitation.
  -  **Malicious Code**: Repositories may include malicious code that threatens the security of your application.

  -  **Lack of Maintenance**: Libraries that are no longer actively maintained may not receive security updates, leaving your application exposed to vulnerabilities.
  -  **Secrets & Tokens**: [Recommendations](#secrets-and-tokens)

Specific to third-party repositories:
  -  **Supply Chain Attacks**: Attackers may compromise the supply chain of libraries, injecting malicious code into the dependencies you rely on.


# Risk Details and Recommendations

## Secrets and Tokens

Code repositories enhance project management, foster collaboration, and contribute to better code quality. Whether youâ€™re an individual developer or part of a team, using a repository is crucial for efficient and effective software development.

  ### Benefits Include:

    #### Version Control
    
    - Code repositories allow developers to track and manage changes made to the codebase over time.
    - Ensures that every modification is tracked and recorded, making it easier to collaborate and avoid conflicts when multiple developers work on the same project simultaneously.
    - Version control systems (VCS), such as Git, enable efficient cooperation by allowing developers to work independently on their part of the code without blocking others
